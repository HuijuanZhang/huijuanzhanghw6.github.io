Hello! This is a website for data science homework 6!  

In this homework, We use [Instacart](http://jeffgoldsmith.com/DSI/dataset_instacart.html) data. We created a flexdashboard using plotly for interactive graphics in __Problem 1__. Then created a shiny-enabled dashboard in __Problem 2__ based on Problem 1.


Dashboard from Problem 1 is [here](problem1/problem1.html).


Dashboard from Problem 2 is [here](https://huijuanzhang.shinyapps.io/p8105_hw6_problem2/).
